About Me

I am a biology student driven by curiosity and a passion for learning, especially in mathematics and new scientific fields. Though my current academic path doesn’t include computer science, I am a dedicated self-learner, eagerly exploring informatics on my own. My discipline, energy, and joyful approach to life keep me constantly engaged—whether that’s working on my web game portfolio or pushing my limits in sports.

While my formal studies focus on biology, I am excited to transition into bioinformatics for my master’s degree. I am motivated by the dream of finding a meaningful job where I can contribute, feel useful, and ultimately achieve personal autonomy to care for my family.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading about quantum mechanics, staying active, and spending time with my beautiful baby girl—my beloved dog. My life is an adventure with more twists than any Netflix series, and I am always ready for the next challenge!
